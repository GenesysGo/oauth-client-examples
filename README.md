# GenesysGo RPC OAuth Client Examples

The following repository houses client implementation examples of our OAuth scheme.

We currently provide examples for:

1. [NextJS](nextjs)
2. [Node.js](nodejs)

## SECURITY ADVISORY

We do not know how each project is built to use our RPC infrastructure. With that in mind, we do not provide any security guidance for how you should secure the `get-token` and `validate-token` API endpoints in these examples. It is up to you and your development teams to implement any protections to keep your credentials and endpoints secure.
